    What is BookBag?
  </div>
  <div class="text-block">
    Bookbag is a distributed library cataloging system designed for the professors of LeTourneau University. Bookbag enables professors to showcase their personal literary collections and allows students to checkout these books. Checkouts are tracked to ensure books are returned in a timely fashion. This system solves the problem of books that are borrowed, but then go missing due to lack of record keeping.
